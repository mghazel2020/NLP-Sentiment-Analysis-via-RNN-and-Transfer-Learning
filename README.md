# NLP: Sentiment Analysis via Recurrent Neural Networks and Transfer Learning

# 1. Objectives:
   
To use implment and evaluate the following sentiment analysis models:
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) model
* Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model: MultiLayer and Bidirectional
* Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model: MultiLayer and Bidirectional
* 1-Dimensional convolution Neural Network model (1-D CNN)
* Transfer learning using the pretrained embeddings of the Word2Vec pretrained model.


# 2. Sentiment Analysis:
Sentiment analysis is the process of analyzing digital text to determine if the emotional tone of the message is positive, negative, or neutral:
Today, companies have large volumes of text data like emails, customer support chat transcripts, social media comments, and reviews.

# 3. Dataset:
IMDB dataset has 50,000 movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytic:

# 4. Requirements
* Our solutions were developed and tested on Google Colab Notebook
  - We recommend the use of Google Colab when deploying our solutions.
